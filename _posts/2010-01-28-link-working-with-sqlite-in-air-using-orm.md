# Link: Working with SQLite in AIR, with the help of ORM

If you don't know what ORM is read the next paragraph, and it might help.  If you do, skip to the links below to learn a little more about how you can make ORM work with AIR and SQLite. ORM stands for [Object Relational Mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), in basic terms the concept of representing your tables-based data as more familiar objects and classes. Not a big concept after all, it's one that I've been using already in my AIR applications - albeit unwittingly and manually.  FlexORM is a project to assist and standardise this process, so it's worth knowing about and trying out.
