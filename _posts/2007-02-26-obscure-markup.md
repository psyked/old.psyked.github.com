# Obscure Markup

This is probably the least tipworthy tip i can find, but here's some of the weirdest, most unusual tags and functions 
you can use in your basic HTML. <http://obscuretags.com/> 

What interests me most is the encoding of base64 data in your text code. (Check previous posts and you can see I've 
touched on this before) But now thanks to this article you can have a look at these links; One for the wiki on it and 
t'other for a website that can generate this base64 code for you from your images. How about that?
