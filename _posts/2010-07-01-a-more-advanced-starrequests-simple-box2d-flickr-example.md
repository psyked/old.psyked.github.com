# A more advanced StarRequests, Simple-Box2D & Flickr example.

[kml_flashembed movie="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2010/07/Main.swf" height="560" width="500" /] Just a little demo I've been working on, following my previous post: <http://www.psyked.co.uk/actionscript/starrequests-simple-box2d-flickr-mashup-sample.htm>. I've basically updated the code a little and swapped out the rectangular Box2D objects for star-shaped Box2D objects, and the code is available on GitHub: <http://github.com/psyked/StarRequests-Examples/tree/master/Box2d-Flickr-Shapes/>
