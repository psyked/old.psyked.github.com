# ADM - Application Descriptor Manager

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/12/adm.jpg) [Application Descriptior Manager](http://www.dehats.com/drupal/?q=node/55) is another application like the [AIR Badger](http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/09/beware_the_air.html) and [Icon Generator](http://clockmaker.jp/labs/air_icon/) \- a development tool, built in AIR, for developing AIR applications.  It's useful, functional and has reassuring touches like auto-backup, or version upgrade buttons. Once installed, you point it at an AIR application descriptor file, which it reads in, and displays the contents in a few simple flex forms.  Of course, editing the XML yourself isn't something that's out of the question normally, but the ADM application makes it all easier to manage - just like the AIR Badger does for the application install badges. [Download the ADM application from Flex My Day.](http://www.dehats.com/drupal/?q=node/55)
