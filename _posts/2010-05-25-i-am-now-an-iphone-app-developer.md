# I am now an iPhone app developer.

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2010/05/iphone-sauron.png) It's finally happened. My tithe to Apple has been paid, and my iPhone has arrived on my desk. I'm still an Flash Platform developer of course, this isn't a career change - it's a broadening of horizons.  I anticipate much cursing and headscratching is in store for the next few months though.  Here we go, should be 'fun'.

## Comments

**[joshenina](#856 "2010-05-26 09:16:35"):** er... yeah, thanks for sharing that with us. a special thanks for submitting this information with us at flash bookmarks.

**[James](#857 "2010-05-26 09:28:11"):** Sorry joshenina - I can't help what the content aggregation websites link to and what they don't. Not a manual submission in this case. Didn't mean to offend!

**[Lawrie](#858 "2010-05-26 09:36:16"):** Hi James - You've chosen an interesting time to start looking at iPhone dev - I thought most Flash developers wanting to go mobile would be waiting for Flash on Android now - I know I am. Good luck with it though - I for one hope you post your projects and experiences with them. Looking forwards to seeing what you make. Good luck!

**[James](#859 "2010-05-26 22:59:01"):** Part of the lag time between getting jobs and actually starting them. I had hoped to be playing around with the CS5 iPhone exporters for my current projects, but that option has sunk since then! I'll do my best to post something useful about it when I understand things a little better...

**[Thomas](#860 "2010-08-10 18:59:51"):** Welcome to the club! Looking forward to seeing what you put together in Obj-C!
