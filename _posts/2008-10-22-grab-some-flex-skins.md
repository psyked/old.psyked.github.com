# Grab some Flex skins.

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/10/skintowin2.jpg) [Scalenine](http://www.scalenine.com) has always been a cool place to see some awesome Flex artwork - for ages now they've had lovely skins like [Obsidian](http://www.scalenine.com/themes/obsidian/obsidian.html)Â or [WMP11](http://www.scalenine.com/themes/wmp11/wmp11.html), but they've recently ran a 'skin to win' competition and have released the winning entries on their site: <http://www.scalenine.com/gallery/>. The winning entries, and the article about them, can be found at <http://scalenine.com/blog/2008/10/16/and-the-winners-are/>... ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/10/skintowin.jpg)
