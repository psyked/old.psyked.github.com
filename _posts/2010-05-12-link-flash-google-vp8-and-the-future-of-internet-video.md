# Link: Flash, Google, VP8, and the future of internet video

Interesting and very thorough post on the history, state of play and possible motivations for the row over Flash and HTML5 video - formats, patents, support; that kind of thing. <http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=292>

**[Tink](#853 "2010-05-12 16:32:47"):** In my experience with Flash (since Flash 5), the owners have never became complacent as this guy states. Flash has continued to evolve and push boundaries at a great pace, and they continue to do so. Another FUD(ish) post to add to the many IMO.

**[May](#854 "2010-05-12 20:58:43"):** Nice ammunition for Flash evangelists hidden in there: So obviously iPhone/Pad only support Baseline Profile h.264, which means it obstructs the use of High Profile h.264 which is significantly better in bandwidth/quality. So much for Apple pushing "modern" technology. In other words: The need to support iPhone/Pad prevents YouTube from serving videos in higher quality. Cheers, M

**[James](#855 "2010-05-13 10:31:11"):** I wouldn't consider this too FUD(ish) - it's just from another perspective, and obviously people have different focuses. I don't believe the Flash owners have been complacent either, they've been rapidly expanding into different areas and adding more capabilities with each version, and that's the thing to remember. Of course someone who sees only the video side of things might consider Flash to have been complacent on that front, but they'll probably be missing the expansion into other areas that are going on in parallel. Interesting tidbits none the less!
