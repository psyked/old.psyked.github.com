# Link: Which JavaScript drawing framework to use?

I haven't yet looked into doing good-old-drawing with JavaScript, but this article is really good at summarising the features of (what I assume to be) the 'Big three' options. Link:Â <http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/22/web-drawing-throwdown-paper-processing-raphael/>

**[interim service](#897 "2013-05-22 11:03:01"):** Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said "You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear." She put the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I had to tell someone!

Armed with your domain and keyword, you are now ready for the second stage. Finishing touches to think about include: A large entry shelf is a platform where the water depth is 8 to 12 inches deep.
