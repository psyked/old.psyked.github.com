# The Office Opening Ceremony...

Remember a [few weeks ago](/press-release/moving-offices.htm), when I muttered something about moving offices?  Well, now we've moved it was about time we had an official opening ceremony - regardless of how corny that might be - but hey, at least we've something to celebrate.  (Especially if you pay much attention to the doom and gloom News). ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/11/officeopening.jpg) I know you're all wishing you were there, but there has to be a limit on attendance.  But fear not - if you weren't there on the day, we have a short film prepared, and will follow up with some photos from the day, just as soon as our official photographer gets sends the images over. ( Hint, hint - Mark ). Check out [the news story on MMT Digital's website](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/news), or check below the jump to watch our video.

**[James](#460 "2008-11-26 15:35:05"):** It was a nice change from the norm - and the free food was good! Marks' taken the hint and is bringing his photos in on Friday. - the slacker is only in the office once a week. Something about spending the other four at University...
