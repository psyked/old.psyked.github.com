# Pittville Degree Show 2007 - see you there?

Well, today's the day. No doubt some of the third-year students at Gloucester Uni are still working on their displays as we speak, but the [Pittville Degree Show 2007 ](http://www.glos.ac.uk/news/degreeshow.cfm)is opening in less than 12 hours now. I'll be along to see if they're up to scratch, and hopefully meet some more of my old uni buddies back there aswell.
