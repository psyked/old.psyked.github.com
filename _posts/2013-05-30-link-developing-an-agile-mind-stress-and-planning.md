# Link: Developing an Agile Mind - Stress and Planning

[Ian Greentree](http://www.iangreentree.co.uk/), another of our Agile developers at [MMT Digital](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/) has been writing about his experiences with Agile development on his blog, and gives us some of his tips for dealing with the stresses and strains of working in an Agile way. 

> As we become too stressed and anxious, we lose our ability to make informed decisions and problem solve.  **As a developer this has a direct effect on quality of the code we write.**

Like many of us, he's experienced the ups and downs of both Agile and traditional waterfall approaches for development, and if you're interested in this sort of thing, check it out in his blog post: <http://iangreentree.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/developing-agile-mind-stress-and.html>
