### 1. It only contains relevant elements.
Call it minimalism if you like, but a good design - and all of the elements that combine to make the final design - should be relevant in the current context.

There is a **balance** to be struck between a minimalist design, conventions and consistency of design, so don't imagine that each design *needs* to be completely different, but relevant functionality only, please. Remember:
- Use the **Minimal** number of elements.
- Follow (or at least, don't contradict) **Conventions**.
- Keep your designs **Consistent**.

### 2. It is understandable without the need for reading.

A good design is one that is able to convey the importance, grouping and purpose of elements of the page without the user having read all of the text on the page. Font size, use of whitespace and visual grouping are all ways of achieving extra levels of clarity.

An effective way to test this is to translate all of the page text into a completely different language - try Chinese, Russian or something else that's completely different to your current page language.

To quickly test a website's 'understandability', you can use a Google Translate URL, such as this: `http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=zh-CN&u=http://psyked.github.com/top-design-tips`

##### Where there is readable text, it is clear about what it does.

As in Apple's design guidelines, buttons and hyperlinks should be verbose enough that there is no confusion about what actions those elements will trigger, so that the user can make an informed decision without the need for interpretation.

### 3. User Interface Icons should be recognisable from their silhouette only.

Icons are a great way to establish a look and feel for your website, but for icons to be effective they need to be distinct enough to convey their purpose as a silhouette only, without resorting to colour adaptations or complex bitmap content. 

In addition, silhouette-based designs are better for accessibility, establishing a visual language, and can be made to look sharper in HTML5. Here's some examples from [GitHub:](https://github.com/styleguide/css/7.0)

### 4. Actions have a predictable reaction.

Across the whole of the website, all elements of a certain appearance should perform the same action.  It's particularly important for elements on the same page, and in the same grouping, but if one tab link performs an AJAX request, all should. If one button opens a modal popover, all should. Icons and colour schemes can be used to convey changes in behaviour whilst keeping an overall consistency of design. 

Keeping things consistent improves the users' trust, and makes them more comfortable with your design.

### 5. It is designed on a grid system, with a consistent baseline.

Most commonly (but not exclusively) a [960px grid](http://960.gs/), your design has a structured grid, and all of the text elements follow a simple vertical rhythm, just like you would have in a printed design. 

#### Using a Grid System
Splitting content up into a grid system is an effective way of partioning your content in a structured manner. It helps both the designer and developer understand the structure of the website and lay out the pages consistently and effectively.

#### Using a Baseline Grid
Much like having a larger line spacing makes text easier to read;

>In design, vertical rhythm is the structure that guides a readerâ€™s eye through the content. Good vertical rhythm makes a layout more balanced and beautiful and its content more readable.

Establishing a baseline in your design also (resportedly) helps you to [design faster.](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/designing-faster-with-a-baseline-grid/)

### 6. Follows (appropriate) conventions

### 7. It uses components appropriately.
Uses appropriate User Interface components, with each having a distinct appearance.
