# AIR Team t-shirt

A bit irrelivant I know, but I thought I'd post anyways as it's just arrived;  ![AIR T-Shirt](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/03/airteamtshirt.jpg) I got a free t-shirt from Adobe (yay me!). As it turns out, Shikha Bhargava - product manager for the AIR Marketplace - posted [this article](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/logged_in/sbhargava_intro_air_marketplace.html) on the Adobe Developer Center at its relaunch. [ImageSizer](/imagesizer-air-application) obviously sneaked in there as one of the first 10 new applications to be added, so I got a free t-shirt.  (As well as a free Digital certificate!)
