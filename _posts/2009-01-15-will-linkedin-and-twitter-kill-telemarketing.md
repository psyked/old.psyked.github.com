# Will LinkedIn and Twitter kill telemarketing?

Will Hawkins asks, ["Will LinkedIn and Twitter kill telemarketing?"](http://arryawke.blogspot.com/2009/01/will-linkedin-and-twitter-kill.html). An interesting thought, based off a recent business experience where using Twitter and LinkedIn proved much more successful than hiring a whole telemarketing company. I can't be bothered with Twitter too much - manly because I don't have a portable medium for Twittering, and I'm never [doing anything Twit-worthy](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/4/23/), but I do use [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesford).

**[James](#514 "2009-02-04 23:14:13"):** Ha ha, yes indeed. I can forsee that we'll have a load of just-as-annoying companies starting up spamming social networking sites though :-S

**[Jonathan](#515 "2009-07-09 12:48:52"):** More than likely it will just be another element of the marketing mix. There will be large segments of potential customers that you will never contact by Twitter, and telemarketing, mail or similar will still be useful. For certain segment, such as 18-24's, of course, it could become a significant contact method, but there are some things that will work better with the immediate feedback and question answering inherent in telemarketing.
