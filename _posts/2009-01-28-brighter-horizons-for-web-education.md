# Brighter Horizons for Web Education

This is an interesting article for 'A List Apart' - basically discussing the fact that Web Education (ie. Design, Development and concepts) and the education model is progressing too slow for it to keep pace with its subject material.  I, and several others I've spoken to all feel the same way - that the course requirements and assignments are too out-of-date and limited before they reach the classroom, and in many situations the teaching staff for these subjects aren't sufficiently skilled or knowledgeable about their subject in order to teach it.  (Which is understandable when you consider it!).
