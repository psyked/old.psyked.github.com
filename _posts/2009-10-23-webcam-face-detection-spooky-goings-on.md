# Webcam + face detection = Spooky goings on...

### ... at MMT Digital.

![Augmented Reality Halloween](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/10/halloween.jpg) Here's a bit of Friday afternoon fun for you.  I was playing around with some Actionscript face detection libraries last night, combined them with a webcam, some dynamic overlays, and voila! Augmented Reality, and just in time for Halloween too.  You will need a webcam to [try it out](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/RVEc4d1cd790afe4ac4be58071a72c98148,,.aspx) yourself, as it's just an early prototype, but we thought it was cool enough to stick on the company homepage for a short while. **Update: **You can see a live version and download the source code, from [this post](/adobe/flash/webcam-face-detection-demo-now-with-source.htm).

**[Hafiz](#709 "2009-11-26 06:34:33"):** Hi, I'm not sure if this app used Marilena for the head detection. But Marilena is Flash Actionscript 3-ported face detection engine. I also did an integration of faceAPI with Flash actionscript 3. But it is not available for web because faceAPI is desktop based engine. So it is more suitable for interactive installation in public space. I have made a youtube video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcEIHjV8xs4 Thanks, i really like your website, very informative and good source of information for interesting projects.
