# Setting up ASDoc in Flex Builder

ASDoc is a command-line tool that you can use to create API language reference documentation as HTML pages from the classes in your Adobe® Flex® application. The Adobe Flex team uses the ASDoc tool to generate the Adobe Flex Language Reference. [From LiveDocs <http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=asdoc_1.html>] Seb (a developer on the PPV3D team) shows you how to set this up in Flex Builder [ http://www.sebleedelisle.com/?p=401](http://www.sebleedelisle.com/?p=401) I could've done with this earlier this week as I ended up using the Command Prompt instead!
