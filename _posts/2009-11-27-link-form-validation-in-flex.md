# Link: Form Validation in Flex

This sounds like a cool AS3/Flex library to try out for the next time you need to validate forms and data in Flex. Â It's an AS3 port of a Java library, supposedly geared towards unit testing, but also happens to be very good for form validation, as Joel Hooks points out in this article; <http://www.insideria.com/2009/11/validation-in-flex-with-hamcre.html>
