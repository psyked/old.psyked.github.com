# What the client sees... and what the developer sees...

I think this demonstrates things pretty well! 

## Timecode: 00:00 to 00:50 – what the client sees.

## Timecode: 00:50 to 02:12 – what the developer sees.

Original location: <http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/21880> This is a difference engine, or calculator, created in the upcoming PlayStation 3 title, '[Little Big Planet](http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en_GB/)'. (Which I can't wait to get myself).
