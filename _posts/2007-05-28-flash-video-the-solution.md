# Flash Video - the Solution?

Working with a lot of Flash video (.flv) I'm acutely aware of the lack in decent, standalone FLV Players. Sure, there's a few out there, but not many that are decent. I have used [FLV Player 1.3.3](http://www.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/FLV-Player-Screenshot-27852.html), but it's not up to much when you're trying to preview or edit files. Adobe's own [Flash Video Encoder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/productinfo/encoder/) is worse than id've thought it would be. You can only encode once, and you can't decode, edit or view the files afterwards. We have been promised the arrival of the [Adobe Media Player](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Media_Player), but that's no comfort until it actually materializes.  By far the best solution for playing Flash Video so far is the [RichFLV 2](http://www.richapps.de/?p=48) \- an Apollo-based desktop FLV Player. It's in Alpha stage of production, (isn't everything nowadays?) but it's already looking far more promising than any competition.
