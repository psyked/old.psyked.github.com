# Video Tutorial Link(s): Getting started with Regex

Ever wanted to learn how to use regular expressions but always thought they looked too complicated? 'In the Woods' are doing a series of tutorials on how to use them. Day 1: [http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/regular-expressions-for-dummies/ ](http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/regular-expressions-for-dummies/)Day 2: [http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/regex-for-dummies-day-2/ ](http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/regex-for-dummies-day-2/)Day 3: [http://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/regex-for-dummies-day-3/ ](http://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/regex-for-dummies-day-3/)Day 4: <http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/regex-for-dummies-day-4/> For most of the tutorials they have a quiz at the end, just to make sure you were paying attention! (It also gives you an insight into the topics they'll cover)
