# "Flex in a Week" with Adobe Media Player

Follow the instructions on this page: <http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/videotraining/?trackingid=EAWOW> and while you're at it, I'd subscribe to a few other Flash/Flex channels, like 360|Flex: <http://www.onflex.org/ted/2008/08/360flex-sessions-media-rss-feed.php> - it's well worth it - there's bound to be something there to interest you...
