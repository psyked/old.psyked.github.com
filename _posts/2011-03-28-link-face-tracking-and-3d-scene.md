# Link: Face-tracking and 3D Scene

![Snapshot from the 3D Scene and Face tracking demo](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2011/03/mrdoob.png) I may be slow on the uptake here, but Mr.doob has some awesome HTML5 and Flash Player showcase pieces over at [mrdoob.com](http://mrdoob.com/). It's hard to pick a favorite, because they're all darn impressive, but I'm a fan of the [Face-tracking and 3D Scene demo](http://mrdoob.com/90/Face_tracking_+_3D_Scene) (which I've screenshotted above).  It's based in Flash, because it has to access the computers' webcam, and is a pretty neat concept. If it didn't require the whole webcam-access notification message that makes the whole effect so obvious, I'd definitely want to slide this into loads of projects, just for the hell of it!
