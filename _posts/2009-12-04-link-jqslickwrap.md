# Link: jQSlickWrap

We've known for quite a while that jQuery is brilliantly clever, but holy cow, the code behind this is pretty damn clever. ![jQSlickWrap](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/jQSlickWrap.jpg) What jQSlickWrap does is automagically work out the shape of the image by extracting the background colour, and then modifies the HTML to wrap the text perfectly around the image. Â Obviously something so awesome won't work on some browsers, but it's designed to cleverly degrade to whatever your browser can manage, which is pretty fantastic.
