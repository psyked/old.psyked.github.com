# Big Ideas (don't get any)

## About this Video

This is a remix of Radiohead's "Nude" (known by its alternative title 'Big Ideas : Don't get any) performed on old computer parts. It was created by James Houston and [in his own words]; 

> Based on the lyric (and alternate title) "Big Ideas: Don't get any" I grouped together a collection of old redundant hardware, and placed them in a situation where they're trying their best to do something that they're not exactly designed to do, and not quite getting there. It doesn't sound great, as it's not supposed to.

Stick with the minute of static and it gets really good. Making busted up hard drives sing is quite an achievement by anyone's standards, but this is something else. 

## The Original
