# Code Completion and other Flex Metadata tricks...

Ryan Stewart [blogged](http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/2009/01/getting-code-completion-on-custom-events-in-flex-with-the-event-metadata-tag/) earlier about getting code completion in Flex Builder with the aid of [Metadata](http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=metadata_3.html) in your actionscript, and it's all very interesting - so take a look! Â Flash CS4 also now supports the Flex-style Metadata tags in your actionscript, although it still doesn't give very good code completion, but it does work with ASDoc, apparently.
