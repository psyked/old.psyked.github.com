# Video link: Content-aware Fill in Photoshop CS5

It's well over a year since CS4 came out and introduced some cool new content-aware transformation tools ([see an earlier post about content-aware scaling in CS4](/adobe/photoshop/a-reason-why-photoshop-cs4-kicks-ass.htm)) and with the release of CS5 it turns out we'll have another awesome content-aware trick added to our toolkit. Â Check this video out: 

I just don't know what to say; it's totally awesome.
