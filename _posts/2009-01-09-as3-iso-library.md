# AS3 ISO Library

<http://code.google.com/p/as3isolib/> 

AS3 ISO Library is a graphics library for easily creating and animating Isometric graphics.  It's a pretty funky style and there's some nice looking graphics in the demo pages for this site.  It's mainly aimed at making games easier to make in this style, but there's a lot of potential if you're creative enough.

It's amazing what kind of projects are out there!
