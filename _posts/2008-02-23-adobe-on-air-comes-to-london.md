# Adobe on AIR comes to London...

Well, I know this is a bit behind the official announcement, but the Adobe **on AIR** tour (that went across the US a little while ago) is soon to begin it's European leg, stopping in 12 European cities.Â  I'm signed up for it, and should be attending the one in London, on the 9th April. [See the official site here.](http://onair.adobe.com/schedule/cities/london.php) ![adobecom.jpg](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/02/adobecom.jpg) I've never been to something like this before, so it should be fun.
