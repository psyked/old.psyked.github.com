# Fiat EcoDrive

This is a video of a new AIR application from FIAT, its built to help you monitor how economical your driving is. It does this by analysing trip data stored on a USB stick (you plug the USB stick into your car on every journey). The video is definitely worth watching - it's a really cool application. See what you think...  [Behind the scenes of Fiat EcoDrive](http://vimeo.com/) from [Serge Jespers](http://vimeo.com/sjespers) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com). Adobe's platform evangelists Andrew Shorten and Serge Jespers talk to Fiat and AKQA about the Fiat EcoDrive application. Find out why Fiat made this application and why Fiat and AKQA chose Adobe AIR to do it. <http://www.webkitchen.be/2009/01/21/behind-the-scenes-of-fiats-ecodrive-adobe-air-application/>
