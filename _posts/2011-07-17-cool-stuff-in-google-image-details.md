# Cool stuff in Google+ - Image details

![A screenshot of the Google+ Image details panel](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2011/07/google-plus-image-shot.png) There are of course many cool things in [Google+](http://plus.google.com), but here's one that piqued my interest on the Geek-factor. When you upload images to Google+ it goes to the trouble of extracting the images' metadata and producing an histogram of the image data - as shown in the screenshot above. I'd guess there's more on the way, judging from the tab-style interface that currently exists. If this sort of stuff interests you, you might like to check out some of the Flash-based histogram and image metadata projects that already exist - the [Histogram](http://je2050.joa-ebert.com/imageprocessing/de/popforge/imageprocessing/core/Histogram.html) class of Joa Eberts' Imageprocessing Library for histograms [[link](http://blog.joa-ebert.com/imageprocessing-library/)] and on image metadata the ["Finding celebrity locations via Twitter — Celebrity Exif data mining"](http://zaalabs.com/2010/07/finding-celebrity-locations-via-twitter/) post from nate of ZaaLabs.
