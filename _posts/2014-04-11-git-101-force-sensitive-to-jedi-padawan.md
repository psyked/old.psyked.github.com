# Git 101: Force-sensitive to Jedi padawan

**What is Git? What does it do, how does it work, how does it fit into my workflow?** If you've ever wondered about the answers to any of those things, this session is designed for you, my friend. Starting with the assumption of no prior knowledge of Git or even of version control, we'll cover the technology at a theoretical level, its manifestation in your projects in the physical level, and your development workflow at the practical level - by which time you'll be ready to step out into the world, secure in your knowledge of what the heck Git is, and ready to use it in your projects - and you'll marvel at how you ever worked without it.
