# Got satisfaction? GetSatisfaction.

My first introduction to [GetSatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/) came through [Flex My Day](http://www.dehats.com/drupal/?q=node/52), and it all looks pretty cool.  The company/service is all about providind a medium for companies with large consumer bases to get in touch with what their clients actually want, which I guess would represent a pretty big investment for a company to figure out and build such a service for themselves, and is probably no small part of GetSatisfaction's success. For a company like where I work our clients don't really fall into that category, so I can't see us being interested in the service, but there's some pretty big names on their roster.  The [developer tools](http://developers.getsatisfaction.com/) look pretty cool, and coupled with Flex My Day's [Flex class libraries](http://code.google.com/p/flexgetsatisfactionlib/), I imagine it might be a cool base to make some sort of customer feedback AIR tool-thingy.
