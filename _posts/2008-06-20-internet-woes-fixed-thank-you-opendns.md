# Internet woes fixed - thank you OpenDNS!

Argh.  For a couple of days now I've been unable to connect to Psyked from my home internet connection, for some inexplicable reason.  I won't claim to understand any of it, but it seemed like the whole internet worked except my domain.  I could even ping other websites on the same shared server, and access Psyked through a horribly slow open proxy server, but direct connection was a no-no. Well, a bit of Googling into traceroutes, pings, hostnames and general techie mumbo-jumbo led me to reconfigure my home networks' DNS servers away from **Virgin broadband** and onto **OpenDNS**. Restart the router and boom! we're back online. There's a lot written about a lot of things (namely problems with Virgin broadband, and some contention over the OpenDNS project).  Here's a few links I picked up, if you're interested; 

  * [OpenDNS main website](https://www.opendns.com/start#)
  * [Techcrunch on OpenDNS](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/18/opendns-wants-to-watch-the-web-for-you/) (cagey about OpenDNS)
  * [Matt Mullenweg on OpenDNS](http://ma.tt/2006/07/opendns/) (for OpenDNS)
