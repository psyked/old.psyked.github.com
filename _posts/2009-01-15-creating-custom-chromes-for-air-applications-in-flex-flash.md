# Creating custom chromes for AIR applications in Flex & Flash

Here's a couple of useful videos from the Adobe TV site.  Yes, a custom chrome is one of the first things that people want to learn how to do, and yes, there's lots of other tutorials around that talk about this - but even after having read many of these, I still found I picked up a few new ideas and tricks from watching these videos.  So if you've got a moment or two, check em out. Ps.  If you get audio but no video, there seems to be a problem with the embed functionality of Adobe TV videos, so try them from the hyperlinks (which run the videos from the main Adobe TV site).
