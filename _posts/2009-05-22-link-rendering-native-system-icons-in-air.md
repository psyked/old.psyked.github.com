# Link: Rendering native system icons in AIR

Here's a cool trick for Adobe AIR - getting native system icons.  So, if you have x application associated with x filetype, you can show the same icon in AIR as you would see on your desktop.  I don't think it can get you the little preview windows you might get for PDFs or JPGs, whether you can get custom icons (like you'd get on your 'My Documents' or 'My Pictures' folders) but it's something cool to check out. <http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/stevencarpenter/entry/air_using_native>
