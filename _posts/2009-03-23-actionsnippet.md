# ActionSnippet

![ActionSnippet](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/03/actionsnippet.jpg) This site has loads of little ActionScript snippets. There's some cool stuff in there - click on 'All Posts' and you'll see a list of them. It's got things like dragging and snapping to a grid, random sort, variable swap, etc etc. <http://actionsnippet.com/>
