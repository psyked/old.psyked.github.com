# Keeping your finger on the pulse with Smashing Magazine

![Smashing Magazine Logo](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2007/05/logo.gif) [Smashing magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) _('we smash you with the information, which will make your life easier. really.') _is one of those pseudo-blogs, regurgitating content from other sites as a method of generating traffic. Well, at least that's what I assume. Behind the ads* there's a wealth of decent resources, and it's updated at a furious rate. For example, there seems to be 100 links+ in each of their '[Best of Month](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/digest/)' articles. (and with that many links, there's gotta be **something good**) They don't obviously write all this content, but seem to read and research everything that's going on through [digg](http://www.digg.com), [digital web](http://www.digital-web.com) and the like, and then prepare and serve it up in healthy doses every week (or more). Head on over there, read their [past articles](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) and sign up to [their RSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-rss.php). You'll thank me later on. * remind me to do a post on how to remove them sometime...
