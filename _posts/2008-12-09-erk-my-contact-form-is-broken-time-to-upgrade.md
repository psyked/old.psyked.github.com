# Erk, my contact form is broken.  Time to upgrade...

Since I'm on a bit of a 'WordPress thing' today, I thought I'd give a mention to the new version of one of my older plugins, WP-Contact form III.  Originally developed by Ryan Duff - whose site has since closed down (creating support problems with the plugin, to say the least) the WP-Contact form plugin was easy way to add contact email functionality to a WordPress blog. Now it seems, Doug of the Marketing Technology Blog has taken on the task of developing the WordPress Contact form plugin, adding new features and keeping everything running smoothly with the newer versions of WordPress.   You can read all about it and download the plugin at: <http://www.marketingtechblog.com/projects/wp-contactform/>
