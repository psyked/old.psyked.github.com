# Getting started with AJAX / Prototype

I thought it was about time I got into some AJAX, or at least got into making use of some Javascript libraries that work with it. Check out the search feature - pretty snazzy, huh? I based it on the AJAX search results plugin ["Addicted to Live Search"](http://addictedtonew.com/archives/145/wordpress-live-search-plugin/) for wordpress by John Nunemaker, and then hacked and customised the Javascript functions to add things like the loading graphic. Suprisingly simple, and one I'll have to remember to write up in the future.
