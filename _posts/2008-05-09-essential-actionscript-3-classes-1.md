# Essential ActionScript 3 Classes #1

[BiteArray.org](http://www.bytearray.org/?page_id=82) has a little collection of several ActionScript 3 Classes that would feel right at home in your core libraries.  There's a [JPEG encoder](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=90), [PDF generator](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=107), [Zip file generator](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=105) and even a class for [gesture recognition](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=91), and many more besides.  It's worth a look.
