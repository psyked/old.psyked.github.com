# Introducing real-time social networking capabilities to the Flash Platform.

[Adobe Flash Collaboration Service](http://blogs.adobe.com/collabmethods/) (formerly known as Cocomo) is a service for well, real-time communication.  Built in, it comes with features such as whiteboards and video chat, and methods for creating your own components.  Pretty cool, huh? It's in Beta at the moment, but will eventually make its way to being a commercial (subscription, I think) offering. For the developers in the audience, have a look at the [official AFCS blog](http://blogs.adobe.com/collabmethods/) or Ryan Stewarts' [getting started](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/cocomo_gettingstarted.html) article.  For the non-techies - or those that just want to know a little more - check out an older [overview](http://blogs.adobe.com/air/2009/01/build_realtime_social_apps_usi.html) covering the technology, while it was still beta and called Cocomo.
