# Kuler Desktop released!

I noticed today that [Kuler Desktop](http://kuler.adobe.com/links/kuler_desktop_051707.air) has arrived. [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com), as [I've mentioned before](/2007/05/15/secret-weapon-1-kuler/), is an awesome tool, and one which I first found out about through my research into Apollo. [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com) was always designed to be one of the first [Apollo aps](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Applications), a community colour-scheme orientated plugin for CS3. It was released early in [Flex](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/), probably to build up a following, with the promised that the [Apollo](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo) one was on its' way. And now it's here. You can [download the .air file](http://kuler.adobe.com/links/kuler_desktop_051707.air) from [Kuler's subdomain](http://kuler.adobe.com).
