# Google Analytics Class - AS3

Here's a couple of scripts that were linked to in the FlexCoders mailing list, some Actionscript 3.0 classes for easily handling the Google Analytics API (via ExternalInterface). I haven't had a chance to test them yet, but it might be useful to someone!

**[James](#276 "2008-12-11 10:21:33"):** Ugh, those links are now broken! Nomatter, you can get the Google Analytics class for ActionScript 3 from Google Code: <http://code.google.com/p/gaforflash/>

**[Theo](#277 "2010-02-25 11:58:00"):** To bad the links don't work anymore. Anyone know where to find theses classes ?
