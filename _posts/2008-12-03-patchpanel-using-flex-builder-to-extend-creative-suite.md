# PatchPanel - using Flex Builder to extend Creative Suite.

This is some interesting [news from John Nack's blog](http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/12/patchpanel.html) \- about using a new SDK available from Adobe Labs called [PatchPanel](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/PatchPanel) to cross-script the Adobe Suite products (Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash etc.). PatchPanel is a library and set of services for enabling swfs to control Creative Suite products - so you can now develop and debug extensions with Flex Builder. Kudos to Mark for sending me the link!
