# I'm going to FLEX:CAMP

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/08/flexcamp.jpg) [FlexCamp London 08](http://www.flexcamp.co.uk/) takes place on the 28th August (next thursday) - I'm going, and there's still places left so [you can go too](http://ria.meetup.com/7/calendar/8491887/). Now primarily I'm still a Flash developer, but given the amount of good things I've seen about Flex - ie. how much easier it could make my life - I'm really keen to get started on it again. I have a subscription to [lynda.com](http://lynda.com/), a couple of Flex books - so now I just need to get hold of a students' Flex licence. But anyway, I'm going to FlexCamp - woohoo!
