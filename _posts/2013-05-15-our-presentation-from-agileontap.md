# Our presentation from #AgileOnTap

Last week (8th May 2013, to be specific) we delivered a presentation at our local Agile business meetup - [Agile on Tap.](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Peterborough/events/110145712/) It all went well, and although I don't have a recording of the presentation (yet); but I do have the slides to share, and here they are.
