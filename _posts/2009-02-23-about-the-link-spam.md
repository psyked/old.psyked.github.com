# About the Link: spam

I'm sorry about this - it looks like Psyked is turning into a links machine. It's really not, you know. I'm trying to avoid it, and write original content, but it's so darned hard to find time (plus, I'm working a lot on things like [ImageSizer](/imagesizer-air-application)). And decent links are so easy to find. So, have faith - I'm working on something original. For now, I'm afraid - it's back to the Link: spam.
