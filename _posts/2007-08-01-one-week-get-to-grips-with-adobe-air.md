# One week get to grips with Adobe AIR...

_"James!"_ they say, _"you've been dying to play with Flex and Air. Make us an application to accompany our E-Newsletter!"_ How could I refuse? _"You have until friday." _ So that's what I've been doing.

I have unfortunately, no previous experience with Flex, Air or even ActionScript 3, so this is proving to be interesting. Marketing has settled on producing an RSS reader - stay tuned and I'll let you know how things turn out in couple o' days.

**[Ryan Stewart](#164 "2007-08-02 02:29:23"):** So what do you think of it now that you're digging in? And have you heard about flexcoders and apollocoders? Both good mailing lists on Yahoo that have community which will respond to questions pretty quickly. =Ryan rstewart@adobe.com

**[James](#165 "2007-08-02 10:03:41"):** It's a bumpy ride, but that's what I expected. MXML is a completely new way of programming for me, but I'm getting used to it. I got clotheslined early on by Airs' window modes and transparency, and yesterday by XML's E4x and then Flexs' mx:Repeater. I've managed to successfully use some of Airs' fileSystem functions though, so at least it's making headway. I'm already on flashcoders - so flexcoders and apollocoders sounds like the next logical step!
