# Figuring out Wordpress

Wordpress is very flexible, as I'm sure you'd guess. But how exactly can you get the best of it, from a coding point-of-view? The danger with Wordpress, of course, is that'd you'd just create yet-another Wordpress Blog. Default settings, popular plugins, familiar layout. Undoubtably they all have their merits, but you'd be niev√© to think there wasn't room for improvement. So, here's me, trying to improve on the Wordpress standards. A little more thought into the information given on a per-page basis, for example. Or different layouts, that sort of thing.  But first, I need to learn how to make Wordpress do what I want, and that's the point of this post. After much fruitless searching, I eventually discovered [this page on Conditional Tags in Wordpress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags), which gives you documentation, theory and examples for the more... selective displays of information.
