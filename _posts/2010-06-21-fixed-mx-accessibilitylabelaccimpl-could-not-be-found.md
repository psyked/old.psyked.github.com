# Fixed: mx.accessibility:LabelAccImpl could not be found.

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2010/06/flash-error.jpg) This came up while converting a Flex 3 AIR project to a Flex 4 AIR project. Â Luckily, the solution is all in the publish settings. Uncheck the box which says 'Generate accessible SWF file' and the error will go away. ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2010/06/flex-publish-options.jpg) Simple!
