# on AIR London / Review

![onairreview.jpg](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/04/onairreview.jpg) Well, despite coming down with a killer headache 1/2 way through the event, I thoroughly enjoyed the London leg of the on AIR tour. All the guys from Adobe and [most of] the 'guest speakers' were really interesting. Toying around with AIR before the event helped understand things a little better, but looking up stuff on the 'net just doesn't compare to having it demonstrated on the tour. Like the [worlds smallest video player](http://www.webkitchen.be/2008/03/07/play-video-in-your-dock-with-air/). I think you can tell something's good if the event-hype subsides and you still find yourself dreaming up ideas.  I believe that the whole day was being recorded - there was certainly some notices up about it, and a DV-Cam setup at the back. Doesn't appear to be online yet, though if I spot it, i'll let you know. In the meantime, here's a flickr image that I found with the MMT Digital lot in... ![](/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2404158741_411bca6e29.jpg) You can find some more at the [flickr onair2008london group.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/onair2008london/)

  * Mike Chambers' post on [Redistributing the AIR Runtime Installer](http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2008/04/07/redistributing-the-adobe-air-runtime-installer/), because AIR isn't a replacement for Director or Zinc, it's coming at a whole new angle - more like Microsofts' .Net Framework.
  * And hey, this wasn't anything to do with the tour, but I noticed it yesterday - a Webcam to Flv encoder, built on Adobe AIR, from zero point nine : [Webcam Digital Video Recorder for AIR. ](http://www.zeropointnine.com/blog/webcam-digital-video-recorder-for-air-updated)
