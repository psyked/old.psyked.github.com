# Can AIR revolutionise E-Readers?

Here's an article from Time magazine that's been doing the rounds because it mentions AIR.  It only mentions it once, but that's good enough to get it on the radar(!).  Stick with it until page 2 and you'll see the mention.  Ignoring the AIR connection, there are a few interesting points in there about the growth and likely technological direction of e-readers - interesting to me not least because MMT Digital works with closely with Hodder publishing, who are understandably interested in e-reader technology.
