# All these physics games...

It seems like fun physics games are on the rise - there's [Launchball](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/launchpad/launchball/), which I've [mentioned before](/adobe/flash/launchball-an-awesome-flash-game.htm) \- but there also seems to be a rise in the numbers of other simple physics games created in Flash. Maybe its because of as3 libraries like [APE](http://www.cove.org/ape/index.htm) making development easier, maybe commerical games like [Little Big Planet](http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en_GB/) are what drive innovation (imitation?), maybe its even just down to the arrival of Actionscript 3 and its enhanced processing abilities. Whatever the reason, games like [Fantasic Contraption](http://fantasticcontraption.com/) and [Magic Pen](http://www.miniclip.com/games/magic-pen/en/) have appeared on the scene, and are well worth a play.Â  (Just don't start playing when you should be working, otherwise you'll be in trouble.) ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/08/attackoftheclones.jpg) If you like those games, you can use classes like [APE](http://www.cove.org/ape/index.htm) to start building your own...

**[pault107](#413 "2008-08-25 13:02:21"):** I love physics games and I'm currently working on one myself. I think you should mention Box2D in your article as the majority of the good physics games being released are using it. APE is good too and is certainly easier to learn (I released a game using it) but Box2D is much more feature rich.

**[James](#414 "2008-08-26 17:37:57"):** I'd never heard of Box2D before, but it sure looks very nice. [Box2D demo page.](http://box2dflash.sourceforge.net/) Nice to know what's powering those physics games too - I'd always kinda assumed they were working off more limited systems...

**[Steorling](#415 "2008-09-07 14:27:05"):** I haven't a clue which app was used, but I'm a teacher and I can't keep my students off of Linerider... not precisely physics in terms of the games you have here, but it does have pretty consistent internal physics. *looks away and whistles* Not that I've ever tried it myself, of course. ;) lol

**[legend of mir](#416 "2009-02-20 22:23:49"):** Fantastic contraption is really good and that magic pen but that gets a bit hard fast
