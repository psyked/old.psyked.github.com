# What's this?

There's a surprising lack of useful implimentations of Papervision 3D out there, so how about this one; ![cmol.gif](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/03/cmol.gif) It's a molecule. Did you know that just about every implimentation of science/education molecule renderers are produced in Java? Well, not anymore. On the horizon is our very own Papervision 3D powered molecule renderer. Huzzah!
