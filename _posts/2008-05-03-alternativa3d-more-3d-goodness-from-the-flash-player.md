# Alternativa3D - More 3D goodness from the Flash Player

3D Flash engines seem to be popping up everywhere at the moment.  [Although I wouldn't call that a bad thing] - Each one tends to take a different approach, do a different demo to distinguish themselves.  Take this for example, a very impressive looking offering from Alternativa3D; ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/05/alternativa.jpg) Papervision might have a lot of features and a large fan-base, but I have yet to see such a visually impressive demo [as this one].  And they've already sorted the first-person movement and collision detection.  It's also very cool that the demo seems to 'quickstart' - loading low-res textures to get you going as soon as possible, and streaming in higher res. ones while you play. ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/05/texturing.jpg) Progressive textures - how cool is that? (above) Of course, there's visual trickery going on here - the fantastic visuals are more down to excellent textures, rather than dynamic lighting or raytracing.  But that doesn't mean that the Alternativa3D team doesn't have that on their 'to-do' list... So, what are you waiting for?  Go check it out at [alternativaplatform.com](http://blog.alternativaplatform.com/en/).
