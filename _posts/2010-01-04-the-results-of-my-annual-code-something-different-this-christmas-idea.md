# The results of my annual "code something different this Christmas" idea.

It's becoming something of a tradition now I guess, but once I've allocated that extra Christmas holiday time appropriately, I find I have that little bit of extra time to devote to trying something new.  This year, I thought I'd try rewriting (again) one of my old university experiments. Here's the result: [kml_flashembed movie="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2010/01/AvatarGame.swf" height="280" width="500" /] It's pretty.  I won't even try to explain the idea behind it, but it's basically an attempt at simple life simulation, with some AI governing the actions.  This time around I've built it with the aid of Box2D, so all the movement, impacts and interaction is achieved by punching some figures into the Box2D world, which makes the thing a helluva lot easier. The big plus of "trying something new"? I now have a basic understanding of trigonometry!  I didn't even have to Google anything!

I also had a similar motivation to do something different, quite randomly, the first weekend of the new year. Sam Rivello's presentation from RIAdventure was the inspiration.

**[Tahir Ahmed](#739 "2010-01-04 20:48:03"):** It looks very nice.

**[James](#740 "2010-01-05 10:04:11"):** Glad you like it guys - I'm quite proud of it, even if it does have the occasional bug!

**[James](#741 "2011-07-20 12:26:38"):** Huh. I should really find the source code for this again, and release it into the wild.
