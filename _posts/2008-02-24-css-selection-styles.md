# CSS Selection Styles?

Did you know you could customize the selection colours of html pages with CSS?  I didn't - until now.  Turns out, there's a [CSS3 pseudo-element called ::selection](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#UIfragments).  Naturally, this isn't yet a technique supported by browsers like Internet Explorer, but it is supported in [albeit with different syntax] by Firefox and Safari.  Interesting, eh?  Check an article on [CSS Selection Styles from Quirksmode](http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html), and have a look at some of the creative effects you can get with it [here](http://metaatem.net/selcolor.php).
