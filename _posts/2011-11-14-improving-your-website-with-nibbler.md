# Improving your website with Nibbler

![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/love-nibbler.png) If you haven't encountered [Nibbler](http://nibbler.silktide.com/) before, Nibbler is a free-to-use website quality checker.  It's developed and maintained by [Silktide](http://www.silktide.com/), and is a tool for checking up to 5 pages of a website against 20 different quality checks - from Social Media to W3C compliance, Alternative text to Semantic HTML.  You can test any website - be it your own or a competitors' website, and you'll get the results from of a wide range of tests returned to you with both a grade, from 0.0  to a perfect 10, along with some background information and suggestions for improvement. Pretty neat, eh? [See how well Psyked.co.uk does on Nibbler.](http://nibbler.silktide.com/reports/www.psyked.co.uk)
