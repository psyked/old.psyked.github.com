# FOTB: Day Zero

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/09/fotb0.jpg) It's coming up to 8pm on Sunday 28th, and that means the Workshops day for [Flash on the Beach 2008](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/) is over - but the fun begins again in only another 12 hours, with talks such as ["Brilliant Ideas that I've blatantly stolen"](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2112), ["Mash-up widgets with Adobe AIR"](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2194) and ["Modulating a lot"](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2186) on the cards for tomorrow. The day was good - I attended the ["ActionScript 3.0 for Designers"](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2108) workshop and Mark went along to the ["Papervision3D"](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2188) workshop.  Met new people, like 'Stu' from [Plagro Web Design](http://www.plagro.com/), recognised others from events like [FlexCamp London](http://www.flexcamp.co.uk/) ([Peter Elst](http://www.peterelst.com/blog/)), and just recognised some from their blogs (like [Aral Balkan](http://aralbalkan.com/), and [Grant Skinner](http://www.gskinner.com/blog/) (at least, I think it was him...))  Remarkably for a full days' staring at projection screens I didn't end up with a killer headache, but no time to ponder that because it wasn't long before we were off to get some food at the [Gourmet Burger Kitchen](http://www.gbkinfo.com/GBK_Locations.htm), shortly followed by a trek over to McDonalds to take full advantage of their free WiFi (because our hotel doesn't offer it!).
