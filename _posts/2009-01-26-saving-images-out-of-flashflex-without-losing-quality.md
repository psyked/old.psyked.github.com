# Saving Images Out of Flash/Flex Without Losing Quality

> Flash Player 10 comes with a nifty new method for the [flash.net.FileReference](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/flash/net/FileReference.html) class called “[save](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/flash/net/FileReference.html#save%28%29)“. What’s dope is that you can send it a ByteArray, and it’ll write it verbatim. This means, saving images out of your Flash & Flex Applications is wicked fast now AND gets around that lamesauce security restriction that plagued a lot of older Flash Player 9 code...
