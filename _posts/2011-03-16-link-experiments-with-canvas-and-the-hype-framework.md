# Link: Experiments with Canvas and the HYPE Framework

Over at [markstar.co.uk](http://markstar.co.uk), you can see some cool experiments that Mark has been working on, and frankly the source code behind them is very cool. ![Look! Canvas!](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2011/03/canvas.png) The experiments themselves are based on the HTML5 Canvas element, and its drawing tools. Â The experiments are part of a series, exploring the initial Canvas element, and then quickly moving into some more familiar Flash-style drawing features, before exploring the possibility of converting the Flash [HYPE Framework](http://www.hypeframework.org/) into an HTML5 Canvas version. All pretty interesting - can't wait to see if he gets onto some of the really cool complex examples of the HYPE Framework. You can check out [the series of experiments in the Canvas tag archive here.](http://markstar.co.uk/blog/category/html5/canvas/)
