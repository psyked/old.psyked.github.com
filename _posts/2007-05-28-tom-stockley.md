# Tom Stockley

[Tom Stockley](http://www.stockleydesigns.co.uk/) was one half of the duo responsible for the branding of the [2006 Pittville Degree Show (Shine!)](http://www.pittvilledegreeshow.co.uk) for which I created the website, following their theme. He studied [BA (Hons) Graphic Design](http://www.glos.ac.uk/subjectsandcourses/undergraduatefields/dgd/index.cfm), and now seems to be working for a company called [Genie](http://www.geniedesignandprint.co.uk/home.html).
