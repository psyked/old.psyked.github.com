# Link: FlashSURF - complex image recognition in Flash Player

FlashSURF is an image recognition library for Flash, distinguishable from other projects like the QR code and face recognition libraries by the fact that it’s just too damn clever. It’s a full colour, high resolution image recognition library that works in real time off a video feed (such as a webcam).  And it comes as a compiled SWC for flash so it’s ready to be used now.  You should at least check out [Eugene's post](http://blog.inspirit.ru/?p=386) on the stuff to get an idea of it's capabilities.

  * Example projects (Google code): <http://code.google.com/p/in-spirit/source/browse/#svn/trunk/projects/FlashSURF.Examples>
Seriously, some people are just too damn clever.
