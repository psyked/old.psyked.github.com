# FOWA '08 (Future of Web Apps conference) - Videos

<http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2008/london/content> ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/10/fowa.jpg) I didn't go to this one, so it's really thanks to [Andrew Shorten](http://www.ashorten.com/2008/10/15/upshotapp-wins-air-contest-at-fowa/) that I found the link, but it looks like FOWA have put videos of the vast majority of all of their sessions online for viewing.  Pretty sweet, huh?  I wish more things would do that - it's a pain having to hunt them down afterwards!
