# Corona SDK: Solving JSON decode error with UTF-8 files.

While working with JSON-encoded data files, I had some problems getting the darn things to work. Â Apart from an unhelpful error message, the Corona simulator gave me no clues as to what was wrong. Turned out that the problem was actually to do with the UTF-8 encoding. And in the end, what fixed it was changing the UTF-8 encoding to **"UTF-8 without BOM"** \- the default UTF-8 encoding just didn't cut it. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/corona-ribbon.png)
