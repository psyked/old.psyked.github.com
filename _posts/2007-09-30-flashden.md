# FlashDen

I'm surprised I haven't come across [FlashDen](http://flashden.net/) before, but here's the deal... FlashDen sells premade flash 'bits'. It's like a marketplace, with every user able to buy and sell flash files, all for pretty reasonable prices. (We're talking $2 - $30 here.) And the files are anything from Preloader bars to fully-featured xml-driven portfolios. It's worth a look.

Have I got anything on there? No. Have I bought anything from there? Not yet. It's got a slick design though, and the Flash content is really inspiring. Like, the kind of stuff I started learning flash for, but then forgot about. I'm certainly going to be studying them for the future, though...

**[Peter](#213 "2007-10-17 21:47:04"):** Good Post. BTW, FlashDen is a really great resource. Over the past year, I have personally bought several flash (UI) elements from that site. For me, it's a genuine 'time saver' since I may not have the time, nor correct skillsets to create alot of the actionscript of the UI elements that I wish to build/use. But I do have enough creativity & web design experience to know what will / won't work. \----------- PROS: Most, if not all, of the Developers will 'personally' help you out if you simply email them directly. Especially if you purchased their widget, or need some advice. CONS: They are all very proficient at what they do, but the skill range of some of the developers varies.... only in terms of how well some of them 'comment their code' for others to follow. But for me, this hasn't really been much of an issue. \----------- I kinda look at it like this... Say I have a client who hires me to build a website... with tons of "bells & whistles". Now, I could either spend considerable manhours creating all the animations, plus writing all the advanced actionscript code required to build a very slick portfolio site from scratch... OR... I could just spend $5-$15 bucks on an 'off-the-shelf' XML Photo Gallery, then simply "customize" it to my client's specifications, pocket some extra profit and have much more free time at my disposal. " Why re-invent the wheel every time out? I think FlashDen a great resource and there should be MORE sites like it. Just my $0.02 cents. -Pete

**[Alex from how To Build A Website](#214 "2008-09-16 04:09:28"):** I just ran into your site while browsing the web, and must admit... I had no clue what you was talking about. I browsed over to flashden and really took a look at what they have to offer. It is really a huge collection of flash objects. Very nice, will keep looking around and see if I find something eye catching. Thanks for the tip. Alex http://www.how-to-build-website.com
