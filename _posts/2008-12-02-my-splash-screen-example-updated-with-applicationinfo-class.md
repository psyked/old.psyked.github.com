# My Splash Screen example - updated with ApplicationInfo class

As I've been playing around with the ApplicationInfo class, I thought my Splash Screen stuff would be so much nicer if it were a little more... generic? ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/12/mysplashscreen2.jpg) So with that in mind, I've updated my Flex Splash screen project to impliment the [ApplicationInfo class](http://psyked-as-classes.googlecode.com/files/applicationinfo.zip), and use that to load information such as the version numbers, application names and application icons. Â Maybe it's not the most efficent way to do things, but what the hell, it's a good example for implimenting the ApplicationInfo class. [Download the updated Splash Screen example Flex project here.](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/12/splash-screen-demo-2.zip)

**[victor azuara](#485 "2009-06-03 23:15:28"):** i try to test your example but i don't have AS_Library.swc

**[James](#486 "2009-06-05 09:12:45"):** Hmm. I'll have to check that download - I would've thought all the files were in there, but I guess not! - Will put a new link up if I can.

**[Juan](#487 "2011-03-22 06:09:06"):** Hey, I don't know if you still have the files for this example. I tried to run it as well and the AS_Library.swc is missing :( And looks like this flex version is quite old, could you do one for the current version? :) Thanks.
