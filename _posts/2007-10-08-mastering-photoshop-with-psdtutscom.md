# Mastering Photoshop with psdtuts.com

[Psdtuts](http://psdtuts.com/) (Photoshop-document tutorials) hit the scene a little while ago on digg, and I've had it on my RSS subscriptions ever since. Off like a dynamo with the Photoshop tutorials, I'd certainly keep an eye on it - looks to have potential to be another Smashing Magazine. (i.e. A big hit) Now, my knowledge of Photoshop is ok, certainly on-par with those I work with, but Psdtuts? I'm a complete novice against them. I tried to do a couple of their tutorials as a demonstration, but they didn't turn out so good. They make it look so easy, but I guess you need some mystical, innate knowledge if you're going to compete.

My favourates have got to be; 

  * [Souping up a photo.](http://psdtuts.com/photo-effects-tutorials/souping-up-a-photo/)
  * [Super-slick lighting effects](http://psdtuts.com/photo-effects-tutorials/super-slick-dusky-lighting-effects-in-photoshop/)
  * [Creating an] [Olde Worlde look](http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/creating-a-stunning-old-world-look-in-photoshop/)
What else can I say? [go have a gawk](http://psdtuts.com/).
