# Google Analytics — Unveiled.

Google have released the google analytics on their google code service – which basically means they’re opening up the API & stuff like that in a similar way to the way google maps works, and allows you to configure and customise it. <http://analytics.blogspot.com/2008/09/decoding-google-analytics.html> I wonder what [Nicolas Lierman](http://www.aboutnico.be/) (the guy who spent months reverse engineering the API to build an AIR Application version of Google Analytics) feels about them just making it open... (Gutted, I bet) **Also:** Ever wondered what the difference is between Google Analytics and Urchin software?
