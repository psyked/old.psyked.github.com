# 3 Snazzy Photoshop tutorials to check out…

There's nothing like a good round of tutorials to help your Monday morning <strike>procrastination</strike> inspiration. If you haven't already seen them, I'd suggest having a look at the following three Photoshop tutorials; 

  * [Creating an Old-Collage effect poster](http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/creating-an-old-collage-effect-poster/)
  * [Using Light & Shade to Bring Text to Life](http://psdtuts.com/text-effects-tutorials/using-light-shade-to-bring-text-to-life/)
  * [Vector Polishing Techniques](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/vector-polishing-techniques/)
And then have a look at this article / tutorial on 'the Polish' (aka. finishing touches) 
  * [Elements of Great Web Design: The Polish ](http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/elements-of-great-web-design-the-polish/)
