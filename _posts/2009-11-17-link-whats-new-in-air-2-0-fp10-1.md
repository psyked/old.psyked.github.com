# Link: What's new in AIR 2.0 & FP10.1

Hot on the heels of AIR 2.0 and Flash Player 10.1 being released on Adobe Labs, Shigeru Nakagaki has done some analysis and produced some (very technical) lists of what's new in them; [API differences between AIR 2.0 and AIR 1.5.2](http://shigeru-nakagaki.com/index.cfm/2009/11/17/20091117-API-differences-between-AIR-200-and-AIR152) [API differences between FP 10.1 and FP 10.0](http://shigeru-nakagaki.com/index.cfm/2009/11/17/20091117-API-differences-between-FP-100-and-FP101)
