# Augmented Reality with Flash

Here's another "wow" project - FLARToolKit (**FL**ash **A**ugmented **R**eality **ToolKit**)  Your webcam, little bit of Papervision, the FLARToolKit, and you're off. It's similar technology to that which powers "Eye of Judgement", and is pretty cool.  If you've got a webcam go and scribble a large black box onto a bit of paper and [test it out](http://saqoosha.net/lab/FLARToolKit/2/). Kudos to [Make me pulse](http://blog.makemepulse.com/2008/06/04/flartookit-augmented-reality-in-flash/) and [Games Alfresco](http://gamesalfresco.com/) for finding the link in the first place!

**[legend of mir](#323 "2009-02-20 22:34:29"):** Wow im gonna have to try that one

**[Chris](#324 "2009-03-25 02:42:51"):** Great toolkit...biggest issue i've found so far is performance squeezing as much as possible out of it. Here is we did for Earth Hour http://earthhour.org/earthinyourhands Let me know what you think...

**[James](#325 "2009-03-25 10:40:32"):** That Earth Hour one is pretty cool - I like the mouse interaction. It seems a little difficult to hold the card and move the mouse, but that does give me some ideas...

**[jpdguzman](#326 "2009-11-16 20:16:39"):** Hey! We did some tinkering about FLAR. Check out <http://www.raincreativelab.com> to see what we have done to FLAR and Papervision. Tell me what you think? Thanks,

**[Adjustable Dumbbells ·](#327 "2010-11-08 13:00:46"):** we always join the Earth Hour because it is one of the ways that you can show your support on the environment .
