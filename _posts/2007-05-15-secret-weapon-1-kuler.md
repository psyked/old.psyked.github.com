Print Designers have it easy, you know. They get things like Pantone Books, and well, things like that. Time to even 
the score? I think so, and obviously so does [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com). Until recently, I'd touted 
[ColorJack](http://www.colorjack.com/) as the best place to gen-up on colour theory and match colours, and it's still 
pretty good. But [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com), from [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com), is awesome for matching up 
colour schemes. Even better than that, you can save your schemes and share them with others. If you're stuck for 
inspiration, take it from someone else's scheme. If you need a good match, you can use 
[Kuler's tools](http://kuler.adobe.com) to pick a theoretical partner. Go ahead, [check it out](http://kuler.adobe.com).
