# Stock Exchange

Free stock photos? Easy. Stock.xchng ([www.sxc.hu](http://www.sxc.hu)) is a lovely little website that offers you just that. There's a little bit of liscensing on some images, and you have to register (for free, however) to view the full-size images, but that's all. It's cunningly tied into their sister site, [stock.xpert](http://www.stockxpert.com), which is of course, stuff you have to pay for.
