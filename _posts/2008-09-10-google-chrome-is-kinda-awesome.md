# Google Chrome is kinda awesome...

If you've been living under a rock for the past week - or maybe just been on holiday - you might not've heard about Google's new web browser called [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).  Chrome is a direct competitior to other browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari. ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/09/google-chrome.jpg) The first I heard about Google Chrome was on [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/01/first-public-screen-captures-of-google-chrome/) the day before it was revealed, and then one of the guys at work downloaded it the next day. News sources all over the place were raving about it - which just shows you the what a link on the homepage of Google can do. As for Chrome itself, there's a few things I really like about it - like no total-browser crashes, better performance, its own task manager and the fact that it uses the Webkit rendering engine - which is the same as the one used by the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR).  Oh, and the fact that I don't have to endure repeated crashes all day long - like I do with Internet Explorer and Firefox. The design something a little different, with a few new takes on old ideas, like tabs and the browser status bar.  But what's really quite interesting is the underlying architecture and the way that they've implimented the javascript - something called jittered JavaScript or JavaVM.  Whatever the hell that is, it apparently means its really fast ([read an article about it on cNet](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10034365-92.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-5)) - and hopefully it also means that old annoyances like javascript locking up the browser will be less of an issue! 

## Can Chrome replace browser x?

**Not right now** \- I don't think.  It's certainly fast and pretty, but for me there's a good deal of things it can't do that other browsers can do.  Like RSS feeds, or the development plugins that I use at work.  These things might be 3rd party extensions to my other browser, but at least they're there. As soon as I can however, I can see myself switching default browsers. Of course, Chrome is still in Beta so it'll be exciting to see it when it goes Gold...

**[Katy](#418 "2008-09-15 14:26:29"):** It actually IS fast ! We've measured the performance for http://www.taskwriter.com, and it's about 9 times faster than IE 6 ! Full details here : http://www.taskwriter.com/blog/how-good-chrome-really-is/

**[katy](#419 "2008-09-22 16:43:13"):** We 've tested Chrome's speed on our application (http://www.taskwriter.com) and it's faster than Firefox 3.0. See the graphs: http://www.taskwriter.com/blog/how-good-chrome-really-is.
