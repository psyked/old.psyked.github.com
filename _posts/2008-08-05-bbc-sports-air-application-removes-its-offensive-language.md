# BBC Sports' AIR Application removes its offensive language

Well, that was fast (and rightly so).  This morning I posted about the [BBC Sports' Olympics AIR Application containing a text file of offensive language](/adobe/apollo/bbc-uses-air-to-install-a-list-of-swear-words-to-users-machines.htm) but now, roughly 1.5 hours after posting here, and 6.5 hours after it being initally posted, a new update has appeared for the Olympics AIR Application. ![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/08/bbc-fixed.jpg) The release notes mention that it's updating the listing events schedule (which it may well be) but it's also changing the contents of the **bbc-swear.txt** file to say '**deprecated functionality**'. (Instead of 1399 ways to swear.) Our experence is that the auto-updater appears a little buggy - clicking update seems to start a background download process, and the installer kicks in when the application is fully downloaded.  Unfortunately without a progress indicator, it seems that things just aren't working.  Nevertheless, a little patience and your application should launch the built in Adobe AIR installer soon enough. Fast (frantic?) work from the BBC!
