# on Deziner Folio...

I've been a bit slack on the External links side of things recently - but [Deziner Folio](http://www.dezinerfolio.com/) really deserves a mention. It's run by two guys - Navdeep and Navin. Deziner Folio is slick, with a nice design, spiffy transitions and, well, generally good ideas with the interface, there's also a host of resources that they make available for download / demonstration - such as 'Web 2.0' Photoshop layer styles and various Image Gallery scripts.
