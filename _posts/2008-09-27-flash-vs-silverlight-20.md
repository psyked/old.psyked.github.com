# Flash vs. Silverlight 2.0

Peter Elst posted something interesting - a counter-arguement to an article published in the "Inside Digital Media" magazine... <http://www.peterelst.com/blog/2008/09/26/flash-vs-silverlight-20/#comment-19297> I haven't got a copy of the article, but Peter's post is interesting.  I think it sets the tone with this quote; 

**“Facebook, MySpace, Google and eBay are not made in Flash, that is undoubtedly due to the fact that at that time they were not able to agree on licensing terms with MacroMedia”**

Pop over there and have a read -  see what you think.
