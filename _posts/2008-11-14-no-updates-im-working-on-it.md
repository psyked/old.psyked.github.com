# No updates?  I'm working on it.

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/11/lbpmessage.jpg) Eesh, how quickly two weeks go by - and its been even longer since I wrote anything new.  I'm working on stuff, I promise.  Blogging can fall by the wayside when you've got distractions like LittleBigPlanet or Spore you know. I have been playing around with Flex and AIR again - I've got plans for a couple of tutorials or something like that - and hopefully very soon we'll have a useful AIR application for download.

**[John](#457 "2008-11-17 09:03:34"):** What's the useful air application?

**[James](#458 "2008-11-17 10:02:12"):** That would be ImageSizer (<http://www.psyked.co.uk/imagesizer-air-application>) - which I'm going to post a little more about soon...
