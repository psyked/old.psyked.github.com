# BETT 2008

Well, I'm off to the [BETT show](http://www.bettshow.com/) on the 9th (tomorrow)  I forget what BETT stands for, but it's an IT exhibition for schools / educational markets.  [Dynamic Learning](http://www.dynamic-learning.com) is being shown off there - as well as being shortlisted for an award - and there's probably going to be a lot of SCORM / LMS related products on display so it should be an interesting one. ... Although I suspect not quite interesting enough to warrent a followup post.
