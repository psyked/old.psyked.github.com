# ImageSizer - now with a Feedback form!

![ImageSizer 0.4.3](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/01/imagesizer043.jpg) I'm a bit of a slave to my own ideas - why else would I spend my evenings knocking together a whole host of not-really-nessesary features for a simple application?  I have to many ideas I want to impliment and too little time to do it, so I'm also acutely aware that I tend to break things without realising, when I try and rush new features through.  Hopefully though, it'll all turn out ok in the end! Today's release of ImageSizer (version 0.4.3) introduces another new feature - the Feedback panel.  Essentially it's just a traditional e-mail contact form - heck, it doesn't even have any validation (yet) - but it should allow anyone who has any ideas or comes across any bugs to drop me a note from within the application.  Kudos to [Eero Koplimets](http://blog.pimpelsang.ee/) for taking the time to suggest this feature! You can download the latest and greatest version of ImageSizer from the badge in the right hand column, or upgrade automatically from a previous version by either a) Opening ImageSizer or b) Opening the Application Settings panel within ImageSizer, and clicking the button marked 'Check for Updates now'.

**[a.goertzen](#527 "2009-10-31 23:29:33"):** 10-31-09 Kim's news letter today touted IS but it looks little like this page. No "contact us" in fact no left panel. Also, sizing does not adjust automatically and hitting #3 has killed it a couple of times. Saving to a folder has overwritten prior other photos with different names. Not complaining, you've got great potential here...

**[James](#528 "2009-11-02 14:31:50"):** Is the version of ImageSizer you're looking at the latest version? It should prompt you to download a newer version when you start the application - hopefully that can sort out any issues with missing panels and crashing. <http://www.psyked.co.uk/imagesizer/imagesizer-0-5-3-is-now-available.htm>
