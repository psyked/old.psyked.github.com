# Recent Posts Range Widget

_'Recent Posts Range'_ is an expansion of the functionality offered by the built-in Wordpress Widget, _'Recent Posts'_ and allows you to specifiy a starting index for your 'Recent Posts' display. Why would we need this? Well, when you have a few post summaries on your homepage, it seems futile to be displaying the same links again in the sidebar, wouldn't you agree? With this widget, you can display some more of your older posts, without cluttering things up too much. Heck, you could even use it with the standard 'Recent Posts' widget to get 'Older posts'.

It's funny where a caffeine-fuelled night will ends up.

**[James](#256 "2007-11-11 02:18:19"):** Some websites that drew code (and inspiration - but mostly code) are.. http://labitacora.net/index.php?p=319 - An original 'Show Range Posts' plugin - but not widgeted or WordPress 2.3 Compatable http://blue-anvil.com/archives/create-a-wordpress-recent-posts-widget - A tutorial on creating widgets for Wordpress (alas, also not WordPress 2.3 Compatable) and finally, the WordPress code changelog - (to make my widget 2.3 compatable) - http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5592

**[regalos originales](#257 "2009-03-03 23:47:47"):** It's great if you want to recicle posts
