# Building Bridges: Some solutions

In a non-too-subtle way, I thought I'd drum up a bit more enthusiasm for [this years' Christmas Game](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/Flash/ChristmasGame2009/Building_Bridges.html), by showing you a few of the solutions that people have come up with for the levels. 

### Type 1: The Basic solution.

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/basic.png) Oh yes, it works for the first level, but just you try that on some of the later ones... 

### Type 2: Adding some support

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/secure.png) That's the basic principle for solving the later levels... 

### Type 3: Support overkill

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/sturdy.png) One things' for sure, it ain't goin' down lightly. 

### Type 4: The Leap of Faith

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/leapoffaith.png) It doesn't all have to join up, you know.  You could just build ramps! 

### Type 5: That's a ropey one...

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/ropey.png) Rope bridges. Flexible, and surprisingly strong. 

### Type 6: The unconventional solution

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/unconventional.png) Sometimes the best solution isn't the most obvious. Like the look of that?  Well, go check out our [Christmas Game: Building Bridges](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/Flash/ChristmasGame2009/Building_Bridges.html), and see what you can come up with!
