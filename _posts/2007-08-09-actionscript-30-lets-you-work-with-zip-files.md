# ActionScript 3.0 lets you work with ZIP files?

From cÃ´deazur: 

> **FZip** FZip is an Actionscript 3 class library to load standard ZIP archives and extract/decompress contained files. FZip parses ZIP archives progressively, allowing access to contained files while the archive is loading.

<http://codeazur.com.br/lab/fzip/> The potential for this is impressive, and they've already implimented it in ways I wouldn't've thought possible - an automatic .air file update checker. I'm not even sure there is a file format left that the ActionScript 3 trio can't manipulate...
