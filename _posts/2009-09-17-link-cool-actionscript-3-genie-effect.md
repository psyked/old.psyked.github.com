# Link: Cool Actionscript 3 'Genie' effect

[This](http://fladdict.net/exp/ginnyeffect/) is an awesome link that [Mark](http://markstar.co.uk/) sent around the other day - a cool Mac-esque 'Genie' effect. ![GenieEffect](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/09/Clipboard-data-15-09-09-22-37-17.jpg) That effect is all very cool, but even more surprising is that it seems to be an Actionscripted effect, rather than a Pixel Bender effect. Â You can find the blog post from the guy that created this [here](http://blog.jactionscripters.com/2009/09/09/genie-effect-with-as3/), and even better can find a live online example [here](http://wonderfl.net/code/b8ec2e7155357ddc65d21eb8b1fa2e94c8363cfc).

**[Sharedtut](#684 "2010-02-03 04:49:04"):** I love this genie effect, thank you

**[Ashi](#685 "2010-04-05 07:38:46"):** I need the same effect in AS 2.0 from where i can get it.

**[James](#686 "2010-04-09 13:34:48"):** @Ashi - There's not currently an AS2 version of that effect, but in theory you could rewrite the code back into an AS2 version. I don't know how well it would work, but you could do it!

**[LK](#690 "2012-06-27 13:18:43"):** Very nice effect, it would be perfect to add it to the windows close event for example.
