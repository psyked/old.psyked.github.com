# GeekWithLaptop

I'm always pleased when I stumble across a website that inspires me, and today I stumbled across [geekwithlaptop](http://www.geekwithlaptop.com/). The articles are nice, loosely related to what I'd normally read, but the main inspiration was the design. It's very bright & clean, although it's not the kind of stuff I'd steal and add into my own designs. The main element I like is the clarity of the navigation, the funky icons, and the options for RSS. Yes, options. One for plain RSS, and one for Feedburner RSS. - That's a concept I can steal without going back on my words...
