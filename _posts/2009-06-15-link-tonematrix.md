# Link: ToneMatrix

![ToneMatrix](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/06/tonematrix.png) [ToneMatrix](http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix), a labs experiment from one of the guys behind the [Hobnox Audio Tool](http://www.hobnox.com/audiotool) is... mesmirizing. The concept is simple - there's a grid, and each block in the grid represents a specific tone.  An invisible playhead constantly loops across the grid and triggers the tones.  You toggle the blocks 'on' and 'off' with a mouse click. Create your own patterns and fine-tune your melody, or draw pictures and see what they sound like - ToneMatrix can keep you occupied for quite a while.  Check it out!
