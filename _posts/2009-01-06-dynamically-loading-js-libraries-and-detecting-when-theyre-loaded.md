# Dynamically loading JS libraries and detecting when they're loaded

This is really useful - <http://www.ejeliot.com/blog/109> I've used it for some of my revised swfobject scripts - loading the latest version of swfobject from the[ Google AJAX libraries](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/hosted_library) in the event that someone forgets to include the local version of the swfobject files.
