# Link: Creating a snazzy background in Flex 4

Peter deHaan has posted a cool example of the way things work in the new Flex 4 'Spark' framework; <http://blog.flexexamples.com/2009/06/13/creating-a-fading-bitmap-fill-background-on-a-spark-panel-container-in-flex-4/> The aim of the new Spark components is to make it much easier to customise the appearance of standard Flex components - similar to the [Degrafa](http://www.degrafa.org/) project. If you're interested in either of these, then I hope you're already signed up for [Flash Camp Birmingham](http://flashcamp.co.uk/), June 16th 2009 (tomorrow), as [James Whittaker](http://jameswhittaker.com/) of [RefreshingApps.com](http://refreshingapps.com/) will be doing a session entitled **"Skinning components with Degrafa & FXG"** which should be interesting!
