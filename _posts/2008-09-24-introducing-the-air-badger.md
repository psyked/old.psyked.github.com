# Introducing the AIR Badger...

This tool (Badger) allows you to easily create air badges for use on your website and offers live previews of the badge. Grant Skinner explainsâ€¦ [http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/09/beware_the_air.html ]( http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/09/beware_the_air.html ) Also, see the article "[Using Badger for Adobe AIR applictions](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/badger_for_air_apps.html)" on the Adobe Developer Connection site.
