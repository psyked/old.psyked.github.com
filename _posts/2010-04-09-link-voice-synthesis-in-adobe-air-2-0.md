# Link: Voice synthesis in Adobe AIR 2.0

![](http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2010/04/voice-synth.png) Here's another cool library for AIR applications.  It works for both Windows and Mac environments, and uses the NativeProcess access of AIR version 2 to tap into the built-in voice synthesis functionality of the operating system.  It's still in development, is more developed for Mac than for Windows (at the moment) but it's looking pretty good already. Should be a good one to have a play with soon! Read the authors' blog post here: <http://blog.technolog33k.fr/adobe-air/20-12-2009-voice-synthesis-in-adobe-air-with-the-nativeprocess-api/> Access the source code for the library from the Google code repository here: <http://code.google.com/p/nativespeech/>
